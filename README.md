# 🏦 Bank Of The Future 💳

## Introduction 📜
Bank Of The Future is a final project developed during the Data Analytics bootcamp with Le Wagon x Saudi Digital Academy.

The objective of this project was to analyze a bank dataset and address the business need of reducing churn rate. By analyzing user behavior, engagement, and retention, we aimed to identify churners and provide business recommendations for improving customer retention.

## Business Need 💼
One of the key challenges faced by banks is customer churn, which refers to customers leaving the bank for various reasons. In order to maintain a strong customer base and maximize profitability, it is crucial for banks to reduce churn rate. Our project focused on analyzing the bank dataset to identify factors influencing churn and provide recommendations to improve customer retention.

## Timeline 🕰️
The project was completed over a span of 2 weeks. During this time, the team worked together to gather, clean, and transform the data, perform machine learning analysis, and visualize the insights.

## Tools Used 🛠️
- Google BigQuery: We utilized this tool for SQL queries to clean and transform our dataset, making it ready for analysis.
- Google Colab: We leveraged Google Colab for implementing machine learning algorithms, conducting data analysis, and performing A/B tests using Python.
- Looker Studio: To visualize our findings and provide data-driven insights, we used Looker Studio for data visualization.
- Notion: We used Notion for documentation, organizing project notes, and keeping track of our progress.
- Canva: We utilized Canva for creating professional and visually appealing presentations.


## Methodology 🔬
1. Data Collection: We accessed the bank dataset which was already uploaded on Google BigQuery. This dataset contained a wide range of users-related information, Transaction & Notifications informations which served as the foundation for our analysis.
2. Data Cleaning and Transformation: We conducted data cleaning and transformation processes using Google BigQuery to ensure data quality and consistency. This step involved handling missing values, correcting data types, removing duplicates, and merging tables to consolidate relevant information.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis: We performed exploratory data analysis to gain insights into user behavior patterns and identify potential churners. This involved visualizing key variables, analyzing statistical measures, and identifying trends and patterns.
4. Hypothesis Creation: Based on our initial exploratory analysis, we created hypotheses to guide our data analysis. These hypotheses helped us focus on specific aspects of the data and identify the most relevant variables for churn prediction.
5. Machine Learning: Leveraging Python, we applied machine learning algorithms to predict churn and test our hypotheses. 
6. Report Generation: We created a comprehensive report that includes detailed findings, and visualizations. The report showcases our analysis and insights, with each page focusing on a specific aspect of the project.

## Report 📊
Our report is a comprehensive overview of the project, consisting of multiple pages with different titles. Each page contains a collection of charts that are related to a specific topic. The charts within each page share a common theme and provide insights into different aspects of the analysis.
